## The Golden Rule: 

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

Hardcode how you want the render function to display
Once hardcoding is finished, create the framework of the TDD
  -inspect the "finished" render elements, right click the element → copy → copy outerHTML, and paste that as the expected value for the TDD.
